            </p>
            
                  <li>Spanning through the course of time, I’ve been a collector of expeditions. Endeavors honed over a spectrum of contrasting yet converging anecdotes that have fueled a sense of being and aligned me to purpose. From each of these fragments, I’ve garnered perception, lenses that have helped me envisage the future and pan out heuristics to leverage my visualizations.  </span></li><br>

                  <li>As a communicator, I’ve sought to speak with simplicity and with sophistication. To me, the fundamental spirit of communicating lies in cognizance. Cognizance augmented with the effort of awareness, through constant and iterative learning endeavors meant to fuel the spirit of inquiry.</span></li><br>

                  <li>As an engineer and a problem solver, I had spent time in understanding the rudimentary concepts of problem solving towards hydraulics, pneumatics, turbo machines and industrial automation. In the process, I had implemented my understanding towards creating an automated tablet filling machine using PLC Programming,usage pertaining to drink and pharma industries, at my time as an intern at Rexroth Bosch.</span></li><br>

                  <li>As a Development Associate, I've manoeuvred the cognizance honed through my proclivity towards communication to continually sculpt a common denominator between the product and the prospect. Concurrently, I managed to oversee and close deals over Rs. 1.5 CR for the organization within the first six months, making me one of the first associates to achieve this milestone.</li><br>

                  <li>As a leader, I've spearheaded a team of twenty associates towards product insight, query handling and administration towards the clientele in efforts to catalyze business growth in the organization. Through the process, I realized that a leader is not a searcher for consensus, but a molder of consensus. A leader is someone who empowers others to surpass their own limitations.</li><br>

                  <li>As a traveller traipsing through the mists of time, I have grown to appreciate and value the calm. The breath has been my tool to slow down and reconfigure. The very essence of the human experience is contained in the achieves of the subconcious. Being able to decelerate and tap into my idiosyncracies has enabled me understand my experience better, and aligned my reality to my purpose. </li><br>

          <h2>Quotes and Excerpts</h2>
          <p>Quotes I like, in no particular order, continuously updated.</p>
        </div>

        
                  <li><em>
“Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes … the ones who see things differently – they’re not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things. … They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."</em> <strong>-Apple Think Different Ad</strong> </li>
<br>


                 <li><em>
“When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.” </em><strong> -Steve Jobs</strong></li>
<br>


                  <li><em>
“The world will ask you who you are, if you don't know, the world will tell you.” </em><strong> -Unknown</strong></li>
<br>

                  

<li><em>
“Some can be more intelligent than others in a structured environment—in fact school has a selection bias as it favors those quicker in such an environment, and like anything competitive, at the expense of performance outside it. Although I was not yet familiar with gyms, my idea of knowledge was as follows. People who build their strength using these modern expensive gym machines can lift extremely large weights, show great numbers and develop impressive-looking muscles, but fail to lift a stone; they get completely hammered in a street fight by someone trained in more disorderly settings. Their strength is extremely domain-specific and their domain doesn't exist outside of ludic—extremely organized—constructs. In fact their strength, as with over-specialized athletes, is the result of a deformity. I thought it was the same with people who were selected for trying to get high grades in a small number of subjects rather than follow their curiosity: try taking them slightly away from what they studied and watch their decomposition, loss of confidence, and denial. (Just like corporate executives are selected for their ability to put up with the boredom of meetings, many of these people were selected for their ability to concentrate on boring material.) I've debated many economists who claim to specialize in risk and probability: when one takes them slightly outside their narrow focus, but within the discipline of probability, they fall apart, with the disconsolate face of a gym rat in front of a gangster hit man.”  </em><strong> -Nassim Taleb, Antifragile.</strong></li>
<br>

<li><em>
“Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.” </em><strong> -Phil Knight, Shoe Dog</strong></li>
<br>

                  <li><em>
“Because once you learn that the vast majority of the planet doesn’t care who you are or what you’re doing, you realize that there is no reason to not be who you want to be. There is no one to please. There is no one to impress. Most of the time, it’s just you, yourself and the stories you invent in your mind."  </em><strong> -Mark Manson</strong></li><br>

“The reality is life is a single-player game. You’re born alone. You’re going to die alone. All of your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. You’re gone in three generations, and nobody cares. Before you showed up, nobody cared. It’s all single player.” </em><strong> -Naval, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</strong></li>

                <li><em>
“Something we cannot see protects us from something we do not understand. The thing we cannot see is culture, in its intrapsychic or internal manifestation. The thing we do not understand is the chaos that gave rise to culture. If the structure of culture is disrupted, unwittingly, chaos returns. We will do anything — anything — to defend ourselves against that return."  </em><strong> -Jordan Peterson, Maps of Meaning</strong></li><br>

“Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day,
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way,
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown,
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way,
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today,
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you,
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.” </em><strong> -Pink Floyd, Time</strong></li>
